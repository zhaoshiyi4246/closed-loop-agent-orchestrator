              AO is not a hosted service. There is no AO account system and no
              AO server that stores your work. Everything AO orchestrates —
              repositories, worktrees, sessions, terminals, agent output — lives

              The AI coding agents you run inside AO (Claude Code, Codex,
              Cursor, and others) are separate third-party tools with their own
              privacy policies. AO launches them locally; it does not intercept,
              store, or forward what they send to their own providers.

              When your server sends you a notification, it is relayed by the{" "}

              <Strong>Apple Push Notification service (APNs)</Strong> on iOS or{" "}
              <Strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</Strong> on Android, which
              deliver it to your device. The payload contains only what is
              needed to display and open the notification — a short title and
              body, and identifiers such as a session or pull-request reference.
              No passwords, tokens, or secrets are included. These platform
              services process the message only to deliver it, under their own
              privacy policies.

              AO Mobile contains{" "}

              Optional waitlists and testimonial submissions are separate from

            <p>
              On desktop, all AO state is stored under <Code>~/.ao</Code> on
              your own machine, protected by your operating system's file
              permissions. On mobile, configuration is stored in app-local
              storage and the connection password is held in the platform secure
              keychain rather than in plaintext.
            </p>
            <p>
              AO Mobile connects over the address and transport (HTTP or HTTPS)
              you configure. The optional LAN listener that serves the mobile
              app binds to your network only while you explicitly enable it, and
              always requires the connection password. Because the server is one{" "}
              <Strong>you</Strong> run, you are responsible for securing that
              machine and the network it is reachable over. We recommend a
              private network such as Tailscale rather than exposing the daemon
              to the public internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              No system is perfectly secure, but because AO holds no central
              store of your data, there is no AO-side database of user content
              that could be breached.

                <Strong>On your devices.</Strong> Data stays until you delete
                it. Uninstalling the mobile app, or clearing its data, removes
                stored settings and the keychain entry and invalidates the push
                token registered with your server. Deleting <Code>~/.ao</Code>{" "}
                removes all desktop state.

                <Strong>Anonymous analytics.</Strong> Retained by PostHog under
                their standard retention schedule. Because these events carry no
                identifier tied to you personally, we generally cannot link them
                back to an individual.

              <Bullet>
                <Strong>Waitlist details.</Strong> Retained in PostHog while
                needed to notify you about the relevant release or AO Cloud
                access, then deleted. You may request earlier deletion using the

              Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access,
              correct, export, or delete personal data about you, and to object
              to certain processing — for example under the GDPR or the
              CCPA/CPRA.
            </p>
            <p>
              In practice, nearly all data AO touches is already in your own
              hands: delete the app, delete <Code>~/.ao</Code>, and it is gone.
              For the anonymous telemetry, the most direct way to exercise
              control is to turn it off using the settings described above. If
              you submitted a waitlist email or believe we hold other data about
              you, contact us privately at{" "}
              <Ext href={COMPANY.MAIL_TO}>{COMPANY.MAIL_TO.replace("mailto:", "")}</Ext>{" "}
