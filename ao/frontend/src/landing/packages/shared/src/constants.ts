// macOS points at the .dmg: this is rollout step 6 of issue #3267, taken once the
// release conductor started publishing a signed, notarized dmg on the stable
// channel. Mounting it gives the drag-to-Applications window, so the app lands in
// /Applications instead of being unzipped into ~/Downloads and launched from
// there, which is what leaves macOS running it translocated or as a stale copy
// (#3617, #3527).
//
// The .zip keeps publishing forever regardless: MacUpdater can only install an
// update from a zip (findFile(files, "zip", ["pkg", "dmg"])), so the dmg is
// first-install only and never replaces it.
//
// These are static releases/latest/download links, so they 404 until a release
// actually carries the asset. Only the STABLE channel builds a dmg; if the links
// ever break, check that the newest non-prerelease release has both files rather
// than assuming the pipeline is broken. The download page itself is resilient
// here: it reads the live release list and falls back to the zip.

// AO Mobile, live on both stores. These are the same links the desktop app's
// Connect Mobile panel opens (frontend/src/renderer/components/settings/
// ConnectMobileGetApp.tsx), so the two must be changed together.
//
// No storefront segment ("/us/") in the App Store URL on purpose: Apple
// redirects a bare /app/ link to the visitor's own storefront, while a pinned
// one sends everyone outside that country to a "not available" page.
