// Terminal Attachment (see CONTEXT.md): the live binding between a terminal
// pane and a PTY over the mux. The hook owns the whole attachment lifecycle —
// open ordering, auto-reattach with backoff, error surfacing, and exit
// handling — so the pane component only renders.
//
// The PTY is either an agent session's pane (the default) or a standalone
// shell terminal the user opened by hand (options.shellTerminalHandleId). The
// mux draws no distinction between them, so only the handle's source and the
// session-specific side effects branch below.
//
// Status rule: the frontend never writes a session's display status. On mux
// `exited`/`error` it invalidates the workspaces query and lets the daemon's
// derived status flow back (docs/architecture.md).
