/**
 * The live browser page renders as a native WebContentsView *behind* the
 * transparent shell. Opening any overlay (the tabs-rail flyout, a menu) raises
 * the shell above that native view (see window-composition.ts's setOverlayOpen),
 * so every shell layer stacked over the page must be transparent for the
 * duration — otherwise the page blanks out for as long as the overlay is open.
 *
 * That contract lives entirely in CSS and cannot be exercised in jsdom, which
 * applies no stylesheet. It has silently regressed repeatedly, each time via an
 * ordinary-looking edit that added or moved an opaque ancestor. These tests pin
 * the contract at the source level: every element that wraps the browser panel
 * and paints its own background must be cleared by the native-composition
 * cascade.
