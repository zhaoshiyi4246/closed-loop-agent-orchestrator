/**
 * Gating a control on an advertised capability, rather than on a refusal.
 *
 * Without this a client learns that a harness cannot steer by drawing the
 * control, taking the press, and withdrawing it — which reads as a bug rather
 * than as a difference between harnesses. The distinction that matters is
 * "not known yet" versus "cannot": both hide the control, but only the second is
 * permanent, and conflating them would either flash a control on every load or
 * hide one that works.
