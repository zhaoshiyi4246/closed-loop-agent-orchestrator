/**
 * Focus hand-off between a menu that is closing and the surface its selected
 * item opened.
 *
 * Radix restores focus after a menu closes, but it defers that restore by a
 * tick (FocusScope dispatches its unmount handler from a `setTimeout`). When
 * the selected item opened a dialog, the dialog has already claimed the caret
 * by then, and the late restore yanks it back out, so the user lands in a
 * composer with no cursor in it.
 *
 * A menu that closes without opening anything leaves focus on `document.body`,
 * so "something outside the menu already holds focus" is a reliable signal that
 * another surface owns the caret. Only then is the restore skipped; Escape and
 * plain item selection keep Radix's normal return-to-trigger behaviour that
 * keyboard users depend on.
 *
 * Skipping it would stop there, except that the dialog cannot return focus for
 * us: Radix captured its return target when the dialog mounted, and that was
 * the menu item, which no longer exists. So the return target is captured when
 * the menu opens and handed back once the surface that borrowed the caret lets
 * go of it.
