 * observer would report every outcome twice; the per-name reservation in
 * captureRendererEvent rate-limits but does not deduplicate, so the duplicate
 * would survive.
 *
 * The payload is already reduced to enum-like fields by the main process, which
 * is also the only place that knows whether an operation was automatic and what
 * version it was fetching.
