// and carries no per-minute cost — dictation is the kind of thing people leave
// on, and a metered one would be quietly expensive.

// Bias the recogniser toward words that show up constantly in agent prompts and
// would otherwise come back mangled ("get" for "git", "MPM" for "npm"). iOS maps
// this to SFSpeechRecognitionRequest.contextualStrings, Android to
// EXTRA_BIASING_STRINGS. Same trick Claude Code applies to its own dictation.
