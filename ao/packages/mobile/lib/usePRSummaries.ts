// Lazy, cached loader for the rich PR view.
//
// The board poll (GET /sessions) carries PR *facts* only — number, state, ci,
// review, mergeability — with no title, branches, author or diff stats. Those
// live on GET /sessions/{id}/pr, one request per session.
//
// So it is fetched here rather than in the store: the store polls every 8s, and
// re-fetching N PR summaries on every tick would be a real battery and latency
// cost over Tailscale for data that changes on the order of minutes. Instead
// each session is fetched once, cached for the life of the screen, and only
// re-fetched when the user pulls to refresh.
//
// The cache lives in a ref, not state: the effect below reads "what do we
// already have" while it runs, and a state value there would be a stale closure
// whenever the session list changed mid-flight. Renders are driven by an
// explicit version bump instead.

// Enough parallelism to load a screenful quickly without opening thirty sockets
// at once on a phone.
