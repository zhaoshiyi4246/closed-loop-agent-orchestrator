# AO CLI

The `ao` CLI is a thin Go/Cobra client for the local Agent Orchestrator daemon.
It starts, discovers, inspects, and stops the daemon through the loopback HTTP
surface and the `running.json` handshake. It must not open SQLite directly or
call runtime, workspace, tracker, or agent adapters in-process.

When using the CLI directly from a shell, make sure the daemon is running first
with `ao start` or by opening the desktop app. Product commands such as
`ao agent ls` and `ao spawn` call the loopback daemon and will fail with a
"daemon is not running" error if no `running.json` points at a live process. From
a source checkout, build and run the local binary explicitly, for example:

```bash
cd backend
go build -o ./bin/ao ./cmd/ao
./bin/ao agent ls
```

## Current commands

Every product command resolves to a daemon HTTP route. Run `ao <command>
--help` for the authoritative flag shape.

`ao agent ls` asks the daemon to ensure display readiness, then prints the
existing table or legacy JSON projection. The daemon alone decides whether a
native check is needed. `--refresh` is a deprecated compatibility flag that
forces fresh installation and authentication checks before printing.

`ao spawn` resolves project context in this order: explicit `--project`,
`AO_PROJECT_ID`, `AO_SESSION_ID` (by fetching the current session from the
daemon), then the current working directory matched against registered project
paths. If `AO_SESSION_ID` is set but the session cannot be fetched, pass
`--project` explicitly.

Agent switching is initially available only for worker sessions whose source
and target harnesses are Claude Code or Codex. The main command
accepts an idempotency key:

```bash
ao session switch-agent ao-7 codex \
  --idempotency-key switch-ao-7-to-codex

ao session agent-switch ls ao-7 --json
```

`switch-agent` and `agent-switch ls` both support `--json`.
The `agent-switch` command also has the `agent-switches` alias, and `ls` has the
`list` alias.

`ao session handoff submit` is the internal source-agent path for optional
semantic enrichment, not a required human step in a normal switch. It requires
the switch ID, exact source launch generation, and a regular file containing
one JSON object no larger than 64 KiB. `--session` defaults to
`AO_SESSION_ID`:

```bash
AO_SESSION_ID=ao-7 ao session handoff submit \
  --switch switch-123 \
  --source-generation generation-456 \
  --file /tmp/ao-handoff.json \
  --json
```

Switching preserves the AO worker session and worktree. It does not translate,
clip, or rewrite provider transcript files; providers continue to own their
native history and compaction.

`ao session claim-pr <pr-ref>` attaches a PR to the current worker by reading
`AO_SESSION_ID`. From an orchestrator or external shell, pass the target
explicitly with `ao session claim-pr <session-id> <pr-ref>`. The explicit form
remains supported for backward compatibility and cross-session coordination.

If `--agent` / `--harness` is omitted, `ao spawn` uses the resolved project's
`worker.agent` config. Before spawning, the CLI performs one targeted launch
ensure. It fails early for unsupported or definitely missing harnesses and
warns-but-continues for unauthorized or unknown observations; daemon session
creation repeats launch validation and native launch remains authoritative.
`--skip-agent-check` suppresses only the CLI warnings and early check, never the
daemon validation.

`ao preview` resolves its session from the `AO_SESSION_ID` environment variable
(it is meant to run inside a session), not a flag. With no argument it
autodetects an `index.html` in the session workspace. Relative file targets are
resolved from the session workspace root, regardless of the shell's current
directory, and served through AO's confined loopback preview origin. Absolute
paths and `file://` URLs must resolve inside that workspace; explicit HTTP and
HTTPS targets remain regular browser URLs.

`ao preview start [configuration]` loads `.ao/launch.json` from the session
workspace, starts that exact command under a session-owned supervisor, selects
or records its loopback port, waits for readiness, and opens application
targets in the Browser panel. `status` reports bounded recent logs and `stop`
terminates the managed process tree. Multiple configurations must be selected
by name; AO does not assign confidence scores to arbitrary localhost servers.
This is an optional, reusable project configuration, not a prerequisite for
preview. Agents must not create it automatically. Static HTML and Markdown use
the direct file preview and must not cause package-manager scaffolding,
dependency installation, or a development server to be introduced.

When a browser-displayable file is the requested artifact, agents should call
`ao preview <workspace-path>` immediately after creating or materially updating
the primary output. Markdown, HTML, PDF, SVG, and common images can be served
directly. Supporting assets must not replace an active application preview.

`ao browser` also resolves its target from `AO_SESSION_ID`, but controls the
session-owned live Electron browser rather than only setting its preview URL.
The target-isolated command set includes `status`, `open`, `snapshot`, `click`,
`dblclick`, `focus`, `fill`, `type`, `press`, `hover`, `scroll`,
`scrollintoview`, `drag`, `select`, `check`, `uncheck`, `get`, `highlight`,
`unhighlight`, `tabs`, `tab new`, `tab select`, `tab close`, `frame`, `dialog`,
`wait`, `screenshot`, `network start/status/list/stop/clear`, `console`, and
`errors`. The native engine is bound internally; there is no second command or
connection setup. Logical tab IDs remain stable for the session, and allowed popups
become AO browser tabs rather than separate OS-browser windows. The AO desktop
app must be open because Electron owns the `WebContentsView`.
References from a snapshot are invalidated after navigation or DOM replacement;
they are also invalidated when changing tabs. Take another snapshot when a
command reports `STALE_REFERENCE`.
Browser waits cover load completion, text or selector appearance and
disappearance, URL matching, fixed delays, and a configurable DOM-stability
window for HMR-driven verification.
Browser tabs in the same worker share a memory-only Electron profile. Different
workers receive distinct partitions, so cookies, authentication, local storage,
and session storage do not leak between their browser runtimes.
Network capture is disabled by default and must be started explicitly. It is
scoped to the active tab at start time, expires after 60 seconds by default
(maximum 300), retains at most 200 in-memory entries, and is cleared with the
tab/session. Captured data is metadata-only: request and response bodies are
never read, sensitive headers are omitted, and URL credentials, fragments, and
query values are redacted.

`go run .` in `backend/` remains a compatibility wrapper around the daemon.

PR actions are available through `ao pr merge` and
`ao pr resolve-comments`. Review actions are available through `ao review ls`,
`ao review trigger` (also `execute` and `restart`), `ao review cancel` (also
`stop`), and `ao review submit`.

## Configuration

The CLI and daemon share the same environment-driven config:

| Var                   | Default              | Purpose                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AO_PORT`             | `3001`               | Loopback daemon port.                                                                          |
| `AO_RUN_FILE`         | `~/.ao/running.json` | PID/port handshake.                                                                            |
| `AO_DATA_DIR`         | `~/.ao/data`         | SQLite data directory.                                                                         |
| `AO_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`  | `60s`                | REST request timeout.                                                                          |
| `AO_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `10s`                | Graceful shutdown cap.                                                                         |
| `AO_KEEP_DAEMON`      | unset (off)          | Keep the desktop app's daemon running after the window closes; stop only via `ao stop`. (fork) |
| `AO_DISABLE_GPU`      | unset (off)          | Skip Chromium hardware acceleration; escape hatch for broken Linux GPU drivers.                |

The daemon always binds `127.0.0.1`.

## Manual smoke test

```bash
cd backend
go build -o /tmp/ao ./cmd/ao

tmp=$(mktemp -d)
export AO_RUN_FILE="$tmp/running.json"
export AO_DATA_DIR="$tmp/data"
export AO_PORT=3037

/tmp/ao status --json
/tmp/ao doctor
/tmp/ao start
/tmp/ao status --json
/tmp/ao stop
/tmp/ao status --json
rm -rf "$tmp"
```

## Adding new commands

Add a product command only when a daemon HTTP route owns the corresponding
mutation/read; the CLI must call that route rather than reimplementing daemon
behavior. Commands not yet exposed but with backend routes in place include
`ao events ...` (over the CDC/SSE endpoint) and CLI parity for PR/review
actions.

Do not port old in-process TypeScript CLI behavior that mixed command handling
with storage and runtime implementation details.

### Claiming upstream PRs from a fork

The registered origin remains the checkout and push repository. An optional
`canonicalRepoURL` in project config explicitly authorizes one upstream repository
for PR claims. Git remotes, including a remote named `upstream`, never grant claim
permission automatically. Both identities must have the same provider and host;
claims match the entire namespace and repository, including GitLab subgroups.

For a project with no other config:

```bash
ao project set-config my-project \
  --canonical-repo-url https://github.com/my-org/my-repo
```

`set-config` replaces the whole config. For an existing configured project, read
`ao project get my-project --json`, preserve its `project.config` fields, add
`canonicalRepoURL`, and submit the complete object with `--config-json`. The same
object is accepted by `PUT /api/v1/projects/{id}/config` as `{"config": {...}}`.
Use an HTTPS repository URL, without a PR/MR suffix, credentials, query, or fragment.
Self-managed GitLab URLs and nested namespaces are supported. Explicit ports
are preserved and must match too; `gitlab.example.com:8443` is a different
authority from `gitlab.example.com`.

Both `ao session claim-pr 42` and `ao spawn --claim-pr 42` resolve numbers against
canonical when configured, otherwise origin. A full PR/MR URL may name either
identity. Unrelated repositories and different hosts/providers remain rejected.
Removing `canonicalRepoURL` restores origin-only claims. This does not unlink PRs
already claimed or move existing worktrees. Repository identity is read at claim
time, so existing sessions need no restart or duplicate project.

Migration 0126 adds an empty canonical identity to existing non-NULL config JSON
where absent, preserving all other settings and any explicit canonical value.
NULL configs retain their defaults. No Git discovery runs during migration, and
no earlier migration is modified. Downgrading preserves config data; older
versions do not support canonical claims and may drop this field when saving
project settings.
