# 2. Capability gateway foundation for interactive TUI reviewers

Date: 2026-08-01
Status: Accepted (gateway); platform isolation required before adapter rollout

## Context

Some reviewer CLIs are useful only as visible interactive TUIs. Agy, Continue,
Devin, Droid, Goose, Kimi, Qwen Code, and Vibe also expose shell escapes or
other general-purpose tools which cannot be made genuinely read-only by prompt
text or launch flags. Running one in a worker checkout can execute project
startup resources, edit files, use Git hooks and filters, commit, push, or read
unrelated host state.

Headless, JSON, RPC, print, and one-shot modes are not acceptable substitutes for
AO's reviewer terminal. A reusable boundary must preserve the real TUI while
granting only the capabilities needed for review.

## Decision

`backend/internal/reviewgateway` is the provider-neutral capability boundary for
future interactive reviewer adapters.

- Each reviewer receives a private neutral working directory, configuration,
  state, cache and temporary roots, an empty Git-hooks directory, and a
  content-addressed task manifest below
  `AO_DATA_DIR/reviewer-runtime/<reviewer-id>`. The project checkout is never its
  working directory.
- The immutable manifest binds a reviewer and worker session to exact review-run
  ids, GitHub PR URLs, target/base object ids, and AO-owned hidden prompt files.
- Source access is structured: list pinned-tree paths, read a pinned blob, bounded
  literal search, pinned diff, and pinned commit inspection. Git argv is constructed
  by AO, with no shell, caller refs, hooks, external diff, textconv, pager, system
  configuration, or optional locks.
- Side effects are structured: post a review only to the manifest PR/commit and
  submit only manifest run ids for the manifest worker. AO selects absolute `git`,
  `gh`, and `ao` binaries; payloads use stdin and fixed argv. The TUI never receives
  an arbitrary-command primitive.
- Prompt reads resolve symlinks and remain inside the AO prompt root. Repository
  paths reject absolute paths, traversal, option injection, NUL, and newlines.
- The gateway uses the existing loopback `ao review submit` flow and does not alter
  listener behavior, database schema, or HTTP APIs.

This is an enforceable capability API when invoked, but it is not by itself a
process sandbox. Agy, Continue, Devin, Droid, Goose, Kimi, Qwen, and Vibe may be
explicitly selected only as experimental host-trusted reviewers. Their native
modes and reviewer-specific autonomous settings do not contain terminal-user
shell escapes, profiles, project plugins, external editors, approval-mode
changes, or network access.

## Required isolation provider

Before any experimental host-trusted adapter is described or shipped as
contained/read-only, the runtime must consume a fail-closed reviewer isolation
profile while preserving the visible TUI:

- macOS/Linux tmux: launch the TUI through an AO-owned sandbox process, mount the
  neutral root read/write and required executable/runtime files read-only, and do
  not mount the checkout. Source access is exposed only through structured gateway
  IPC. Network egress allows only the selected model provider, GitHub review API,
  and AO loopback submission endpoint.
- Windows ConPTY: apply the equivalent boundary with an AppContainer/restricted
  token, job object, explicit filesystem ACL/capability grants, and outbound network
  policy. ConPTY remains the terminal transport, not the security boundary.
- On every platform, the sandbox starts fixed TUI argv directly, supplies only the
  neutral HOME/config/state roots, blocks project MCP/plugins/extensions/hooks/
  startup files, and terminates when the TUI exits. It never falls through to a
  user shell.

The runtime must reject an isolation request when the platform provider is absent
or cannot prove its policy. Hiding the checkout, same-user permissions, or prompt
command filtering is insufficient.

## Acceptance tests for adapter rollout

1. The actual provider interactive TUI renders and accepts subsequent pane-injected
   review messages in tmux and ConPTY; cancellation uses the real TUI key.
2. TUI shell escapes and arbitrary commands cannot read the checkout or home, write
   outside the neutral root, start project commands, commit, push, or connect to an
   unapproved destination.
3. Symlink, traversal, leading-option, ref, submodule, hook, pager, external-diff,
   textconv, environment, plugin/MCP, and executable-replacement attacks fail.
4. Reads/search/diffs return only manifest-pinned objects; mismatched run, PR,
   commit, worker, or prompt requests fail closed.
5. GitHub posting and AO submission work through fixed operations and cannot be
   redirected to another task.
6. Killing, cancelling, restoring, detaching, and TUI exit leave no host shell and
   no writable checkout, including after daemon or desktop restart.

## Consequences

Future reviewer adapters share one capability surface instead of embedding
provider-specific command allowlists. Unit tests cover host-side authorization and
command construction. Platform sandbox implementations and escape/network tests
remain a prerequisite for describing these experimental reviewers as
contained/read-only. Until then, each must retain its host-trust warning.
