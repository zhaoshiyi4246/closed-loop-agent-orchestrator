# 1. A second, authenticated, plaintext LAN listener for mobile access

Date: 2026-07-07
Status: Accepted

## Context

The daemon binds `127.0.0.1` only. AGENTS.md carries a hard rule: _"The daemon is
a loopback-only sidecar. Do not make the bind host configurable or expose it beyond
`127.0.0.1`."_ That rule keeps the Loopback Listener safe **without authentication**
— the OS guarantees nothing off-box can reach it.

We want a physical phone to use the app over the local network. The only prior
mechanism was a standalone Node proxy (`ao-phone-proxy.js`) run by hand, with
IP trust-on-first-connect and no password. The user rejected the proxy approach and
asked for an in-app "Connect Mobile" feature.

Two forces collide: exposing anything to the LAN removes the loopback safety
guarantee, and the target mobile app is **Expo/React Native**, where trusting a
self-signed TLS cert (fingerprint pinning) requires native modules across three
transports (`fetch`, the `/mux` WebSocket, and the xterm WebView) — a large, risky
effort at odds with the desired scope.

## Decision

Add a **second HTTP listener inside the daemon**, bound to the LAN, gated by auth.
The Loopback Listener is left byte-for-byte unchanged (desktop/CLI stay
unauthenticated). This **overrides the AGENTS.md loopback-only hard rule**, by
explicit user decision on 2026-07-07; AGENTS.md should be amended to scope that rule
to the Loopback Listener.

Security posture:

- **On-demand.** The LAN Listener does not exist until Connect Mobile is enabled;
  disabling closes the socket. Default off — zero standing LAN surface.
- **Single rotating Connection Password**, 8-char alphanumeric, stored only as a
  hash, compared constant-time. Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <password>` on both
  REST and the RN WebSocket (RN's WebSocket header option). Rotating drops the
  current phone.
- **Per-source Lockout** after 5 failed attempts (not global — a hostile device
  must not be able to lock out the real phone).
- **App API only** on the LAN Listener; daemon-control routes keep their existing
  loopback-only guard (`localControlRequest`) with no change.
- **Plaintext transport (HTTP), accepted.** No TLS. The feature is
  **home-network-only** and the UI says so. The Pairing QR therefore carries only
  host+port (non-secret); the Connection Password is delivered out-of-band (read off
  the desktop screen, typed into the phone), so a captured QR alone cannot connect.
- State persists to `~/.ao/mobile/config.json` (atomic write), honoring the
  "all state under `~/.ao`" rule. The listener re-binds on the default port with an
  ephemeral fallback; the QR always reflects the actually-bound port.

## Consequences

- The daemon gains a network-facing, authenticated attack surface whenever Connect
  Mobile is on. Loopback behaviour is unaffected, so desktop/CLI carry no regression
  risk.
- On untrusted networks the Connection Password and all traffic are exposed to
  sniffers. This is an accepted, stated limitation, not an oversight.
- TLS is deliberately deferred. A future upgrade (TLS listener + a `fingerprint`
  field in the Pairing QR + RN cert pinning) is additive: it does not require
  reworking the auth, lifecycle, or persistence chosen here.
- AGENTS.md must be updated so the loopback-only rule reads as scoped to the
  Loopback Listener, or future agents will (correctly) flag this code as a violation.
