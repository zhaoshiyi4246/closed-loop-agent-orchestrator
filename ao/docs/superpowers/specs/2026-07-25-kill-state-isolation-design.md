# Session Kill State Isolation

## Problem

`ShellTopbar` persists while the selected session route changes. Its
`TopbarKillButton` child currently has no session-specific React key, so React
reuses the component when the user switches workers. Confirmation, pending
mutation, and error state from worker A can therefore appear while worker B is
selected.

## Intended Behavior

Killing a worker affects only that worker's controls. If the user switches from
worker A to worker B while A's kill request is pending, worker B shows its normal
Kill button and does not expose A's confirmation, progress, or error state. The
request to kill A may continue in the background.

## Design

Render `TopbarKillButton` with `key={session.id}`. A session change then unmounts
the old button instance and mounts a new instance with clean local and mutation
state. This establishes the session ID as the component identity without adding
state synchronization or changing the daemon API.

Alternatives considered:

- Reset local and mutation state in an effect when `session.id` changes. This is
  more complex and can briefly render stale state before the effect runs.
- Store kill state in a parent map keyed by session ID. This is unnecessary
  because the UI only presents controls for the selected session.

## Testing

Add a `ShellTopbar` regression test that:

1. Renders worker A and starts a kill request that remains pending.
2. Switches the route parameter to worker B and rerenders the persistent topbar.
3. Verifies worker A's dialog and pending state are gone and worker B has a clean
   Kill button.

The focused `ShellTopbar` tests and frontend typecheck must pass. No backend,
storage, or API contract changes are required.
