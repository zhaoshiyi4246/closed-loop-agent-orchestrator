// 202 rather than 200: the provider accepts the guidance and then acts on it at its
// next model-request boundary — measured about five seconds later against
// codex-cli 0.146.0. What changed by the time this returns is that the agent has the
// correction, not that it has done anything with it, and 200 would claim otherwise.
//
// Strictly better than the interrupt-and-resend it replaces: the turn keeps its id,
// its reasoning and its in-flight work, and settles `completed` rather than
// `interrupted`. That is why it is a separate route instead of a flag on send — the
// two do different things to work the user has already waited for.
