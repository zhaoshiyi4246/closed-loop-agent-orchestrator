// stageAttachments writes files into a live session's worktree and answers with
// the paths the caller should name in the message it sends next.
//
// Two steps rather than one field on the send body, because the transport is the
// path and not the bytes: a conversation carries text, and a file reaches the
// agent by being a file the agent can open. Staging separately also means a write
// that fails is reported before any message claiming to carry an attachment is
// recorded — the timeline never shows an attachment that is not on disk.
//
// The caps and blocked-type rules are the spawn ones, unchanged: this is the
// same operation against a session that already exists.
