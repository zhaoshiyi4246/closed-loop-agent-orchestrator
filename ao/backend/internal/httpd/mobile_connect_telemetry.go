// A phone that has paired is indistinguishable from one that has not, from the
// desktop's point of view: pairing mints no device record, no handshake, and no
// session. The phone simply starts sending password-authenticated requests to
// the LAN listener. So the only honest signal for "a phone actually connected"
// is the first request that passes authMiddleware on that listener, which is
// what this reports.
//
// Everything the renderer can see stops at intent — the modal was opened, the
// bridge was switched on. Both happen whether or not anyone ever scans the QR.

// connectedReportWindow is why this type exists rather than an Emit call inside
// authMiddleware. Every request from a paired phone passes that middleware,
// including each image, stylesheet, and script of a preview page (those
// authenticate by cookie). Reporting per request would emit thousands of events
// per phone per minute, which is the exact shape of stream that produced AO's
// PostHog bill.
//
// One event per transport per day answers the question that was asked — how
// many installs have a phone connected, and over which transport — at a volume
// of at most a handful of events per install per day.
