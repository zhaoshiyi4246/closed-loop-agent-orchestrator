-- execrows so the caller can tell "appended" from "no such activity yet", which is

-- the row.
-- As with command output, a capped stream stays immutable so a provider that keeps
-- emitting cannot create a no-visible-change CDC storm.
-- NOTE: keep these comments ASCII. sqlc locates its star-expansion edits by byte
-- offset, so a multi-byte character here silently corrupts later queries.
