// StageAttachments writes files into a session's worktree and returns their
// worktree-relative paths, for a caller that will name those paths in the message
// it is about to send.
//
// It is a separate step from sending rather than a field on the message because
// the transport is a path reference, not the bytes: the conversation port carries
// text, and a file reaches the agent by existing in the worktree the agent can
// read. Staging first also means a failed write is reported before a message
// claiming to have attachments is recorded in the timeline.
