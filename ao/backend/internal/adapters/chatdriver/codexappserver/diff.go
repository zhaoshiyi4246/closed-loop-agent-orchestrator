// Turn-diff parsing.
//
// `turn/diff/updated` does not carry a structured file list. Its whole payload is
// one aggregated git unified diff string for the turn (measured against
// codex-cli 0.146.0; the generated schema agrees -- V2TurnDiffUpdatedNotification
// is `{threadId, turnId, diff: string}`). Per-file path, counts, and change kind
// therefore have to be read out of the diff text here, in the adapter, rather
// than arriving ready-made.
//
// The structured alternative, `item/fileChange/patchUpdated`, reports one ITEM's
// changes. It cannot answer "what has this turn changed so far" without AO
// accumulating and de-duplicating items itself, which is a second source of truth
// for something the provider already aggregates correctly.

// maxDiffFiles bounds one turn diff. A refactor that rewrites a generated
// directory can produce thousands of entries, and this row is re-read by every
// snapshot poll; a caller is told the list was cut rather than shown a short list
// as if it were whole.
const maxDiffFiles = 500

// parseTurnDiff reads a git unified diff into per-file entries.
//
// Patch is deliberately left empty. The turn view needs path, counts, and kind;
// carrying every hunk would put the entire diff into a row that a client polls
// once a second, and the full text is already recoverable from the worktree.
