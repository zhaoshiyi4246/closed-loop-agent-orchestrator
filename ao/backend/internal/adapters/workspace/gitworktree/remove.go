// Worktree removal races process exit on Windows. A PTY (or any agent child)
// rooted in the worktree can still hold a handle on that directory for a short
// window AFTER the call that killed it returned — the OS releases handles
// asynchronously during process teardown, and the process is already gone from
// every liveness probe by then. os.RemoveAll fails with
// ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION / ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED ("The process cannot access the
// file because it is being used by another process"), even though nothing is
// meaningfully using the directory anymore and a retry a moment later succeeds.
//
// This is reachable from `ao session kill` on a session whose scoped shell
// terminals were just destroyed: Session Manager closes the shells, then
// removes the worktree immediately, inside the same request. Measured release
// latency ran past a second with two shells open, so the budget below is
// deliberately generous — a kill that takes a few extra seconds is strictly
// better than one that 500s and strands the worktree.
//
// These are vars, not consts, so tests can drive the loop without sleeping for
// real.
var (
	// removeAllAttempts × the capped backoff below bounds the total wait at
	// 7250ms: 50+100+200+400+500×13 across 18 tries (17 sleeps). Sized from
	// measured behaviour — a two-shell session was observed still holding its
	// worktree past the 5s mark — with headroom on top, since the alternative
	// to waiting is a failed kill that strands the worktree. Finite so a
	// genuinely wedged directory still surfaces as an error rather than
	// hanging the request forever.
	//
	// This budget is per PATH, and Session Manager removes a workspace
	// project's repos one at a time while holding that session's shell-terminal
	// gate, so N repos can serialize into N × this. Keep it comfortably under
	// shellterm's sessionGateWaitTimeout ÷ a realistic repo count, or a slow
	// teardown starts turning concurrent opens into gate-busy 409s. Honouring
	// ctx below is what keeps that bounded in practice: a caller that gives up
	// stops the whole chain rather than paying every repo's budget in turn.

	// removeAllRetryEnabled gates the retry to the platform whose handle

	// immediate, and sleeping out the budget before returning the identical
	// error only makes every genuine failure slower. A var, not a bare
	// runtime.GOOS check at the call site, so tests exercise the retry loop on
	// every platform CI runs — otherwise the coverage below would silently
	// evaporate everywhere but Windows.
	removeAllRetryEnabled = runtime.GOOS == "windows"

	// the retry loop deterministically instead of depending on platform
	// filesystem locking semantics (the real sharing violation only reproduces
	// on Windows).

// removeAllWithRetry is os.RemoveAll plus a bounded, backing-off retry for the
// transient Windows sharing violation described above. A path that is already
// gone is success (os.RemoveAll's own semantics), and the last error is
// returned unwrapped so callers can still match on it.
//
// Retries stop early when ctx is done: time.Sleep is uninterruptible, so
// without this a caller that has already given up (client disconnected,
// deadline passed) would still pay out the remaining budget — and with a
// workspace project's repos torn down serially, several of them in a row.
//
// Within the retry the decision is deliberately unconditional on error
// identity rather than sniffing for a Windows errno: the syscall surface
// differs across Windows versions and filesystems (and Wine/CI shims), and
// every error os.RemoveAll can return there is either
// transient-and-worth-retrying or permanent-and-still-an-error after the
// budget. The backoff starts short so the common case (handle released almost
// immediately) costs ~50ms, and grows so a slower release does not burn the
// attempt budget in the first half-second.
