// no activity signal — e.g. SessionStart (metadata only, v1), a Notification
// type we don't track, or a SessionEnd reason that doesn't actually end the AO
// session — in which case the caller reports nothing.
//
// event is the AO hook sub-command name installed in claudeManagedHooks
// ("user-prompt-submit", "stop", "notification", "session-end", ...), NOT the
// native Claude event name. Keeping this beside hooks.go means the events AO
// installs and what they mean live in one place.

		// (approval means the tool ran — the earliest observable "the
		// decision was resolved" signal, since answering a dialog fires no

//     awaiting the next instruction — that is Idle, not a blocking request,
//     so a stop/interrupt reads Idle rather than "Input Needed".
//   - agent_needs_input: a request for user input that carries no tool
//     identity — waiting_input (automated nudges stay suppressed via
//     NeedsInput, user sends deliver). It must NOT map to blocked: without a
//     tool to correlate, the block could only lift at a turn boundary,
//     rejecting user sends long after the question was answered.
//   - permission_prompt: a pending permission decision (blocked — a stray
//     Enter could answer the dialog). It duplicates the earlier
//     permission-request hook, whose payload names the blocking tool for the
//     correlated clear.
//   - agent_completed (fired by `claude agents` background sessions,
//     CLI 2.1.198+): the turn finished — Stop semantics, idle but alive.
//
// Other types (auth_success, elicitation_*) carry no activity meaning, as
// does a malformed payload.
