// launching a provider's native CLI into a terminal and writing keystrokes at
// it. A Chat driver speaks a machine protocol and reports typed events. Stretching
// one contract over both would make every call site guess which one it has.
//
// Rules this port exists to keep:
//   - provider DTOs never escape the adapter; callers see domain vocabulary;
//   - terminal byte streams are never a source of Chat events;
//   - an empty user message is not "press Enter"; there is no keystroke concept;
//   - shell-terminal lifecycle is unrelated to conversation lifecycle.
