# AO CLI Catalog

`ao` is a thin CLI over the local AO daemon. Every command is `ao <command> --help` for the authoritative flag list.

| `project` | Register, inspect, configure, or remove projects | Setting up or managing repos AO knows about | [commands/project.md](commands/project.md) |
| `orchestrator` | List orchestrator sessions | Viewing which sessions are orchestrators | [commands/orchestrator.md](commands/orchestrator.md) |
| `review` | Submit a reviewer result for a worker's PR | Completing a code review loop | [commands/review.md](commands/review.md) |
| `send` | Send a message to a running agent session | Correcting or directing a live agent | [commands/send.md](commands/send.md) |
| `preview` | Start a session-owned app or open an exact URL/file | Running and showing the worker's relevant app, Markdown, HTML, PDF, or image | [commands/preview.md](commands/preview.md) |

## Conventions

- Most read commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output.
- `-p / --project` scopes session subcommand lookups to one project.
- Session and project ids are shown by `ao session ls` and `ao project ls`.
- `--agent` is an alias for `--harness` on `ao spawn`.
- Every command accepts `-h / --help` for the full flag list.
- For frontend launch, preview selection, or artifact handoff, read
  [commands/preview.md](commands/preview.md) before acting. Its static-file,
  project-runtime, and automatic-handoff rules are load-bearing.
- For page inspection, interaction, or request diagnosis, read
  [commands/browser.md](commands/browser.md). It defines shared-tab behavior
  and the opt-in network policy.

Use [references.md](references.md) only when a natural-language request does
not map clearly to a command above.
