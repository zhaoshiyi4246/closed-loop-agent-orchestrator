// ReviewerHarness identifies a code-review agent. It is a separate vocabulary
// from AgentHarness on purpose: a reviewer-only tool (e.g. the Greptile CLI)
// must not become a valid worker, and a worker harness does not automatically
// become a valid reviewer. The two sets are maintained independently and only
// happen to share ids where the same tool serves both roles.

// Supported reviewer harnesses. Add a reviewer-only tool here (and register its
