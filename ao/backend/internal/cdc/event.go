// Package cdc is the change-data-capture delivery layer. Change events are
// captured durably by SQLite triggers into the change_log table (see the storage
// migrations); this package POLLS that log and fans new events out, in order, to
// in-process subscribers such as terminal session-state fan-out. Future SSE/event
// endpoints can subscribe here too.
//
// There is no durable outbox/JSONL/janitor machinery: the change_log table IS
// the durable, ordered source of truth, and clients catch up by reading it from
// their own offset (SSE Last-Event-ID). The poller + broadcaster here are only
// the LIVE push on top of that.
