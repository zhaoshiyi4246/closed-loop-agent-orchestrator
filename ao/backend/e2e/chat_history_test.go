// Rollback is the one worth running for real. Every unit test can prove AO sends
// the right frame and hides the right rows; only a live provider can prove the
// agent actually FORGOT. That is the whole claim, and the way it fails in
// production is subtle: the timeline looks right and the agent answers as though
// the discarded turns are still there.
//
// Titles are here for the other half: `thread/name/set` is a provider call whose
// only visible effect arrives back on a notification, so the round trip through
// the daemon into sessions.display_name cannot be checked any other way.

// rollback discards a turn and everything after it, and reports the count.
