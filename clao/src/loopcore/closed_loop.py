"""Closed-loop controller.

Wires exceptional evidence through Observer -> Auditor -> Planner ->
ActionExecutor, while an evidence-rich first completion can run the
deterministic Gate before invoking semantic roles.

A single pass (`step()`) reads fresh AO events for the bound Worker, runs the
Observer, and if a new alert fires builds an EvidenceBundle -> Auditor ->
Planner -> ActionExecutor. CANDIDATE_DONE triggers the Integration Gate;
Gate pass -> DONE.

State machine transitions are persisted. Budgets enforced. --dry-run runs the
whole pipeline up to (but not executing) ao send/spawn/gate.

Idempotency: each alert triggers at most one audit; each audit at most one
planner action; each action executed once. Process restart resumes.
